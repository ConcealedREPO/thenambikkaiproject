        <p class="information">
          The Nambikkai Project was started in March 2021 by Malaysian students, with the <span>aim of purchasing computers for children in local orphanages, and teaching them how to use them</span> â€“ including recognising pieces of hardware, surfing the Internet, word processing, and introductory programming. The project has the <span>long-term goal of encouraging underprivileged children to enter professional fields</span> when they <span>grow up</span>, as well as raising awareness amongst the local community on the importance of digital literacy in the modern world.
